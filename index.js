//go to inspect - console - and then type javascript
//data types in javascript - boolean,number,string
//to check data type of js - write typeof(number,string,true or false)
//to store anything in memory while writing in javascript use variable
//variable= var myName="ashutosh"; like this
//var ek box banaega memory m us box ka naam h myName jiski value hogi Ashutosh
//promt is use for taking input from user
//var yourName= promt("enter your name");

 /*var a=8;
var b=3;
console.log("a is "+ b);
console.log("b is "+ a);  consol.log ka use karte h print karte time
 "concactination" use for string example:- "hello"+"world";
